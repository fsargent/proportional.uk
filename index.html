          The UK's "choose-one" First-Past-the-Post system guarantees a
          two-party dominance, forcing voters into tactical decisions rather
          than allowing them to vote for who they truly support.

        <p>
          This isn't a radical idea. It's a proven system used across Europe
          that would empower voters and lead to a more representative
          government. For the Labour Party, a party of progress and reform, this
          is a historic opportunity to fix our broken political system.

          Fair Share Voting: A Hybrid Proportional Solution
        </h2>
        <p>
          Fair Share Voting combines the simplicity of closed list proportional
          representation with a vote transfer system to ensure every vote
          counts. Voters choose their preferred party, and seats are allocated
          proportionally. Parties below a 5% threshold have their votes
          transferred to other parties based on pre-declared transfer
          preferences that are announced before the election, ensuring maximum
          representation while maintaining the simplicity voters expect.

              <li>
                <strong>Initial Allocation:</strong> Each party gets seats based

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Threshold Application:</strong> Parties below 5% cannot

              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Vote Transfers:</strong> Below-threshold votes are
                transferred to other parties based on each party's pre-declared
                transfer preferences (e.g., Green Party declares that their

            <h4>üîÑ Understanding Vote Transfers</h4>
            <p>
              The transfer system ensures that every vote contributes to
              representation, with two types of transfers:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Below-Threshold Transfers:</strong> When a party falls
                below 5%, ALL their votes are transferred to their pre-declared
                preferred party (e.g., if Green Party gets 4%, all their votes
                go to Labour as declared before the election)
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Surplus Vote Transfers:</strong> Even winning parties
                may have surplus votes above what's needed for their seats -
                these are also transferred to their preferred parties
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Pre-Declared Preferences:</strong> Each party must
                publicly announce their transfer preferences BEFORE the
                election, so voters know exactly where their votes will go
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Democratic Process:</strong> Transfer preferences are
                set through internal party democracy and consultation with
                supporters
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Wasted Votes:</strong> Every vote contributes to
                electing representatives, even if not from the voter's first
                choice
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Coalition Building:</strong> Transfers encourage parties
                to work together and find common ground
              </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="transfer-timing">
              <h5>‚è∞ When Are Transfer Preferences Set?</h5>
              <p>
                <strong>Before the election:</strong> All parties must publicly
                announce their transfer preferences well in advance of voting
                day. This ensures complete transparency and allows voters to
                make informed decisions about which party to support.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Democratic consultation:</strong> Each party's transfer
                preferences are determined through internal democratic
                processes, often including member votes and consultation with
                supporters.

                <strong>True Representation:</strong> Seat share matches vote

              <li>
                <strong>Every Vote Counts:</strong> No "safe seats" or "wasted

              <li>

              <li>
                <strong>Diversity:</strong> Parties can ensure their lists

              <li>
                <strong>Party Accountability:</strong> List composition and
                ordering is transparent and subject to internal democracy
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cross-Regional Support:</strong> Voters can support

            <p>
              Fair Share Voting is an innovative hybrid system that combines the
              simplicity of closed list PR with the representation benefits of
              vote transfers. While more complex than pure proportional systems,
              it ensures maximum representation with no wasted votes, making it
              a powerful tool for electoral reform in the UK.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Remember:</strong> The goal is maximum representation with
              electoral stability. Fair Share Voting achieves this through its
              hybrid approach.

          Regional Representation and Cross-Regional Support
        </h2>
        <p>
          One of the key advantages of Fair Share Voting is how it handles
          regional representation through its innovative transfer system. Under
          the current FPTP system, regional parties like the SNP, Plaid Cymru,
          or the Northern Irish parties are limited to their geographic regions.
          With Fair Share Voting, these parties can receive votes from
          supporters across the entire UK, and when they fall below the 5%
          threshold, their votes are transferred to other parties based on
          pre-declared transfer preferences, ensuring regional voices still
          influence national politics.

        <h2 class="section-header">Party Internal Democracy</h2>
        <p>
          Fair Share Voting strengthens party internal democracy in two key
          ways. First, parties must create and maintain candidate lists that
          reflect their values and priorities through transparent internal
          processes. Second, parties must establish transfer preferences through
          democratic consultation with their members, giving party members a
          direct say in both who represents them and where their votes go if
          they fall below the threshold.

              <p>
                When a party falls below the 5% threshold, their votes are
                automatically transferred to other parties based on the
                preferences you set above. This ensures no votes are wasted and
                maximum representation is achieved.
